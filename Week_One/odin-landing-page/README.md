# Odin Landing Page – Week 1 Progress

This is my first HTML & CSS project as part of **The Odin Project**.  
I built a basic landing page using only HTML and CSS — no frameworks!

## 🗓️ Week 1 Highlights
- Learned HTML elements and structure
- Styled with CSS and practiced Flexbox
- Understood the box model
- Created a responsive, clean landing page from scratch

## 🚀 Live Demo
